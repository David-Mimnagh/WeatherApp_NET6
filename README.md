# WeatherApp
This C# .NET 6 app used the Angular spa template with OIDC as a basis in order to save time(Not really at the end as OIDC caused a few problems when deployed). 
The Simple CI/CD pipeline was created using the deployment function on the App Service within Azure.
Understandably, there would be a lot more that I would like to do with this, like splitting out the functions possibly introducing some sort of CQRS implementation and removing OIDC and substituting it with Azure AD, along with adding a suite of tests to cover this funcionality and adding those as part of the pipeline run.

# Workboard 
A basic Devops board was used and can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/c7833facd75e4363804fc4457a9ce428?v=38a6ffee88f040f98a93714cf480070a) where I tracked my work
